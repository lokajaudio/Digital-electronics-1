1. [Introduction](#introduction)

   In this project we are going to use board *CoolRunner-II CPLD* a sonic range meter module *HC-SR04*.
   The *HC-SR04* will be measuring range from a static object and print it to the seven segment display.

   We will be using:
   
   #Ultrasonic Ranging Module HC - SR04
   
   It provides 2cm - 400cm non-contact measurement function, the ranging accuracy can reach to 3mm. The      modules includes ultrasonic transmitters, receiver and control circuit. The basic principle of work: (1) Using IO trigger for at least 10us high level signal, (2) The Module automatically sends eight 40 kHz and detect whether there is a pulse signal back. (3) IF the signal back, through high level , time of high output IO duration is the time from sending ultrasonic to returning. Test distance = (high level time√óvelocity of sound (340M/S) / 2)
   
   #CoolRunner-II CPLD
   
   The CoolRunner-II CPLD starter board is the perfect platform for the evaluation and implementation of designs using a high performance, low-power CPLD. Targeted applications include intelligent handheld devices, remote monitoring, wireless interfacing, and glue logic across any number of industries. 
   
   #Features:
    Xilinx CoolRunner-II CPLD (XC2C256-TQ144)
    A 256-macrocell CoolRunner-II CPLD in a TQ-144 package
    An 8 MHz fixed-frequency oscillator and a socket for a crystal oscillator
    Expansion connectors for 64 I/O signals (32 on the Pmod ports and 32 on the parallel connector)
    A one-wire DS28E01Q EEPROM
    DataGATE switch
    Requires a USB A to mini-B cable for power and configuration (not included)
    Four 12-pin Pmod ports
